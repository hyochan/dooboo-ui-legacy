# PinchZoom

This Component is a component which makes child components zoomable.

## Props

| Property             | Required | Type        | Default |
| -------------------- | :------: | ----------- | ------- |
| style                |          | `ViewStyle` | {}      |
| children             |          | `ReactNode` | null    |
| blockNativeResponder |          | `boolean`   | `true`  |

### style

The PinchZoom is an Animated.View using panResponder to react for touch events. So, it need a style like common View component.

### children

It's just ReactNode type.

### blockNativeResponder

If this value is false, then some gesture handler of parent view can terminate this panResponder.
It would be useful at inside of ScrollView or FlatList.

## Usage

Currently, I only checked that it works at the chrome browser at the Android platform.
At other browsers, the `pinch-zoom` gestures worked for the whole screen.
You can check the source code of the below screen by clicking `Show code` at bottom of it.

<Canvas>
  <Defatult />
</Canvas>
